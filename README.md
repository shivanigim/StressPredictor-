# StressPredictor
Stress Detection Using Wearable Device Sensors
Steps done 
•	Understand data set structure and format
•	Explore and construct prediction model
•	Clean and transform data to a set eligible to construct prediction model
•	Created site with easy to use UI for input observable data
•	Integrate prediction model with website
•	Built an API to predict Stress by taking data from user's wearables.

Future Work and Contribution: 
•To integrate UI with user wearable in order to  create system which may be used by organizations for measurement of stress in patients and thus bringing down the chances of heart attack due to stress related features. By submitting results on the API,an idea about the mental stress condition on stressed or affected conditions of patients with the designated graph for a particular time period will be developed.
