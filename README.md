StressPredictor: Stress Detection Using Wearable Device Sensors
StressPredictor is an innovative project that leverages data from wearable device sensors to detect and predict stress levels. By utilizing machine learning techniques and a user-friendly interface, this tool aims to help individuals and organizations monitor stress levels and potentially reduce the risk of stress-related health issues.

## Highlights
Utilizes wearable device sensor data for stress detection
Implements a machine learning prediction model
Provides a user-friendly web interface for data input
Offers an API for seamless integration with wearable devices
Potential for organizational use in monitoring patient stress levels

## Steps done 
•	Understand data set structure and format
•	Explore and construct prediction model
•	Clean and transform data to a set eligible to construct prediction model
•	Created site with easy to use UI for input observable data
•	Integrate prediction model with website
•	Built an API to predict Stress by taking data from user's wearables.

## Overview
StressPredictor analyzes data from wearable devices to predict stress levels, potentially helping to reduce the risk of stress-related health issues such as heart attacks. The project includes a prediction model, a web-based user interface, and an API for integration with wearable devices.
How it works
Data from wearable device sensors is collected and processed

Future Work and Contribution: 
•To integrate UI with user wearable in order to  create system which may be used by organizations for measurement of stress in patients and thus bringing down the chances of heart attack due to stress related features. By submitting results on the API,an idea about the mental stress condition on stressed or affected conditions of patients with the designated graph for a particular time period will be developed.
